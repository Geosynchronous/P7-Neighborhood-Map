**Introduction**
- This APP was written as a Course Project Requirement for the **Udacity Front End Web Developer Nanodegree Online Course**
- It was also coincidentally written for the world wide **Round River Conservation** non-profit organization
- The APP is a great way to have central access to online resources and social networking for this organization
- A weather API was accessed to provide realtime weather stats for each Round River location on this Earth
- The APP UI was designed to responsively work on smart phones, tablets and computer
- The APP can be quite useful to potential/current Round River Students and Alumni glearning more about and contributing to this conservation effort
- THe APP can also be quite useful to the Administration and Staff for making presenations to various audiences, such as educational, scientific, conservation, funding agencies and the general public
- Round River has been using GIS Mappng for decades now, and it is a vital part of their organization, this APP has the potential of expanding into all kinds of functionalities both for education and research
- If Round River finds this APP useful, I may try to pursue a fudning grant from **Google** to pursue further development
- Currently the decades of resources from Round River and the comprehensive functionality of Google Maps resources provides an enourmous about usefulness
- This APP could be very useful in the classrooms and homes on all continents, and for all age groups
- This Earth is a beautiful place, and if this App can help us humans find a sustainable way to live on this planet, then any effort here will be well worth it... hallelujah!!!
