**Introduction**
- This APP was written as a Course Project Requirement for the **Udacity Front End Web Developer Nanodegree Online Course**
- It was also coincidentally written for the world wide **Round River Conservation** non-profit organization
- The APP is a great way to have central access to online resources and social networking for this organization
- A weather API was accessed to provide realtime weather stats for each Round River location on this Earth
- The APP UI was designed to responsively work on smart phones, tablets and computer
- The APP can be quite useful to potential/current Round River Students and Alumni glearning more about and contributing to this conservation effort
- THe APP can also be quite useful to the Administration and Staff for making presenations to various audiences, such as educational, scientific, conservation, funding agencies and the general public
- Round River has been using GIS Mappng for decades now, and it is a vital part of their organization, this APP has the potential of expanding into all kinds of functionalities both for education and research
- If Round River finds this APP useful, I may try to pursue a fudning grant from **Google** to pursue further development
- Currently the decades of resources from Round River and the comprehensive functionality of Google Maps resources provides an enourmous about usefulness
- This APP could be very useful in the classrooms and homes on all continents, and for all age groups
- This Earth is a beautiful place, and if this App can help us humans find a sustainable way to live on this planet, then any effort here will be well worth it... hallelujah!!!

  - Only one of these buttons can be selected at a time.
  - Selecting one button closes the previous button along with all the markers on the map and the corresponding list in the options box
  - Toggling one of  the buttons will clear the locations from the list and location markers on the map, toggling again will restore the map to it's original layout with all the necessary location markers shown
