##Project Development

7:15 PM

- **Project Plan**
- Just Read over the [Project Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/17/view)... Wow!  What a challenging project!
- Need to start from the project from scratch... right now the project folder is empty, except for this document log.
- I will create an interactive map project that might be of use the non-profit organization [Round River Conservation Studies](http://www.roundriver.org/)
- I will use information from their website, and newly released media information, as well as third party APIs
- The "Neighborhood" will be the whole world, I will start with by using Administrative and Field Locations that are on Four Continents, and it will use the satellite view
- Additional functionality will be added in, and seperated as I move through the [developmment plan layed out in the course](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd001/parts/00113454014/modules/271165859175462/lessons/2711658591239847/concepts/26906985370923)
- First I will have the basic map rendered as above, using previous code in the course as a model.  Once the satellite view renders with some basic location markers, I will then, move it into an MVVM model, and start implementing knokout framework, and then I will make it responsive for all devices before moving on to greater functionalities.
